# File Integrity Checker

A **File Integrity Checker** is a security tool used to detect unauthorized modifications in log files or any critical files by computing and verifying cryptographic hashes (SHA-256). This project guides you through building a simple, effective tool to track file integrity and identify tampering.

---

## Project Overview

The tool will:

* Accept a file or directory path as input.
* Compute SHA-256 hashes for each file.
* Store these hashes securely for future reference.
* Compare current file hashes against stored hashes to detect changes.
* Allow manual re-initialization or update of the stored hashes.

By completing this project, you'll learn about hashing algorithms, file I/O, scripting best practices, and basic security concepts.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment

* Ensure you have **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.
* (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

* Create and navigate to your project directory:

```bash
mkdir file-integrity-checker
cd file-integrity-checker
```

---

### Step 2: Design the Integrity Checker Script

* Create your Python script file:

```bash
nano integrity_checker.py
```

* (Write your hashing logic, CLI commands parsing, etc.)

---

### Step 3: Implement File Hashing Functionality

* Use Python‚Äôs `hashlib` in your script to compute SHA-256 hashes.
* Ensure your script handles files and directories.

---

### Step 4: Write Command Logic in the Script

The script will support these commands: `init`, `check`, and `update`.

### Step 5: Testing Your Tool

Run these commands to test the functionality:

```bash
# Initialize hashes for all files in a directory
python3 integrity_checker.py init /path/to/logs

# Check for any file modifications
python3 integrity_checker.py check /path/to/logs

# Update the stored hash for a modified file
python3 integrity_checker.py update /path/to/logs/filename.log
```

**Example:**

```bash
python3 integrity_checker.py init /var/log
python3 integrity_checker.py check /var/log
python3 integrity_checker.py update /var/log/syslog
```

---

### Step 6: Optional Enhancements

* Add logging:

```bash
# Use Python logging module inside your script
```

* Encrypt stored hashes or secure storage location.
* Set up alerts for detected changes.
* Package as a CLI with argument parsing libraries (`argparse`).

## Example Project Structure

```
file-integrity-checker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integrity_checker.py    # Main Python script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .hashes                 # Hash database file (generated after init)
```

---

## Summary

By following this guide and running the commands above, you will create a reliable tool to:

* Initialize and store file hashes securely,
* Detect unauthorized file changes,
* Update known good hashes when needed.

This is a practical security project to boost your scripting, cryptography, and system monitoring skills.
